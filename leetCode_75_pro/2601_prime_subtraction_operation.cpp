2601. Prime Subtraction Operation

Hint
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.

You can perform the following operation as many times as you want:

Pick an index i that you havenâ€™t picked before, and pick a prime p strictly less
than nums[i], then subtract p from nums[i]. Return true if you can make nums a
strictly increasing array using the above operation and false otherwise.

A strictly increasing array is an array whose each element is strictly greater
than its preceding element.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,9,6,10]
Output: true
Explanation: In the first operation: Pick i = 0 and p = 3, and then subtract 3
from nums[0], so that nums becomes [1,9,6,10]. In the second operation: i = 1, p
= 7, subtract 7 from nums[1], so nums becomes equal to [1,2,6,10]. After the
second operation, nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is
true. Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,8,11,12]
Output: true
Explanation: Initially nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so we don't
need to make any operations. Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,8,3]
Output: false
Explanation: It can be proven that there is no way to perform operations to make
nums sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is false.


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
nums.length == n
